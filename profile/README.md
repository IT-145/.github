# IT 145
Welcome to the IT 145 organization. This repository contains a collection of projects that I developed as part of the IT 145 course at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this course, I focused on mastering the fundamentals of Java programming and applying these concepts to build robust and efficient software applications.

# About the Course
IT 145 is a foundational course in computer science that emphasizes the principles of programming using Java. The course covers a comprehensive range of topics, including methods, objects, classes, decision structures, loops, arrays, ArrayLists, inheritance, input/output, debugging, and abstract classes and interfaces. The projects within this organization reflect the culmination of my learning and practical application of these essential concepts.

# Key Topics Covered:
- Methods/Objects/Classes: Mastery of creating and utilizing methods, objects, and classes, which are the building blocks of object-oriented programming in Java.
- Decision Structures/Loops: Implementation of conditional logic and iterative processes, crucial for developing dynamic and responsive applications.
- Arrays and ArrayLists: Effective management of collections of data, with a focus on manipulating and iterating over these structures efficiently.
- Inheritance and Multiple Classes: Application of object-oriented principles such as inheritance to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
- Input/Output and Debugging: Handling user input/output operations and employing debugging strategies to identify and fix errors in code.
- Documents: Proficiency in file handling, including reading from and writing to files in Java.
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Understanding advanced OOP concepts that allow for flexible and scalable code architectures.

# What You'll Find in This Organization
This organization contains the following repositories:
- Project One: Pet Boarding and Grooming Application
  - A Java application designed to manage pet boarding and grooming services. This project emphasized applying OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and constructor usage.
- Project Two: Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application
  - An expanded application that introduced complex concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. The software manages tracking information for both dogs and monkeys used in search-and-rescue operations, demonstrating advanced OOP practices.

# Reflection
Through these projects, I have developed a strong understanding of Java programming and core object-oriented principles. The course projects challenged me to think critically, solve complex problems, and apply best practices in software development. These experiences have prepared me for more advanced programming courses and real-world software development scenarios.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope these projects provide a clear representation of my programming skills and the depth of my understanding of Java.
