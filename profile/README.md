## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# IT 145 Projects
Welcome to the IT 145 Projects organization. This repository showcases the various projects I developed during my IT 145 course at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this course, I gained a solid foundation in Java programming, focusing on essential programming concepts and industry-standard best practices.

# About the Course
IT 145 is an introductory course that lays the groundwork for understanding and applying Java programming. The course covered a broad range of topics, including object-oriented programming, decision structures, loops, arrays, inheritance, and more. Each project within this repository reflects my learning journey and practical application of these core concepts.

# Key Topics Covered:
- Methods/Objects/Classes: The basics of creating and using methods, objects, and classes in Java, which are the building blocks of object-oriented programming.
- Decision Structures/Loops: Implementation of conditional logic and iterative processes, which are crucial for building responsive and dynamic applications.
- Arrays and ArrayLists: Managing collections of data and understanding how to manipulate and iterate over these structures efficiently.
- Inheritance and Multiple Classes: Applying object-oriented principles such as inheritance to create more complex and modular code.
- Input/Output and Debugging: Handling user input/output and developing strategies for identifying and fixing errors in the code.
- Documents: Understanding file handling in Java, including reading from and writing to files.
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Advanced OOP concepts that allow for creating flexible and scalable code architectures.

# What You'll Find in This Organization
This organization contains the following repositories:
- Project One: Pet Boarding and Grooming Application
  - This project involved developing a Java class to manage pet boarding and grooming services. It focused on applying OOP principles like inheritance and encapsulation.
- Project Two: Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application
  - This project expanded on the first by introducing more complex concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. The application manages tracking information for both dogs and monkeys used in search and rescue operations.

# Reflection
Through these projects, I developed a strong understanding of Java programming and object-oriented principles. The course projects challenged me to think critically and solve problems effectively, which has prepared me for more advanced programming courses and real-world software development scenarios.
